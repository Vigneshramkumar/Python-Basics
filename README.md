# Python-Basics
Basic Concepts of Python
This repository contains the basic concepts of python. I used Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda-3) for this Project Purpose.
Anaconda is a package which contains Python and IDE for the same like Spyder, Jupyter Notebook etc. The advantage of using Jupyter Notebook is that you can save the changes and run at any point of time.
You can download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ .
